## 🎯 What is Gitgenix?

Gitgenix lets you create **pixel art on your GitHub contribution graph**! Design patterns, logos, text, or any image you want, and Gitgenix will generate a script that creates the exact commits needed to make your art appear on your GitHub profile.

### ✨ **Why Use Gitgenix?**

- 🎨 **Express Your Creativity**: Turn your GitHub profile into personal art
- 🚀 **Stand Out**: Make your profile memorable to employers and collaborators
- 🎯 **Easy to Use**: Visual editor - no coding required
- 🔄 **Reversible**: Can be applied to past years without affecting current work
- 📱 **Works Everywhere**: Responsive design works on all devices

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Simple Steps!)

### 1. **Design Your Pattern**

- Visit [Gitgenix](https://Gitgenix-github-art.netlify.app/)
- Select which year(s) to include
- Click and drag on the grid to create your design
- Use different intensity levels (0-4) for varied shading

### 2. **Configure Your Repository**

- Enter your GitHub username
- Specify a repository name (create a new one if needed)
- Set the branch (usually "main")
- ✅ Gitgenix validates your repository automatically

### 3. **Generate & Run**

- Click "Generate Script" to download your custom script
- Run the script in your repository folder
- Push to GitHub and watch your art appear!

## 📋 What You Need

- **GitHub Account**: Where your art will appear
- **Git Installed**: To run the generated script
- **Repository Access**: Create a new repo or use an existing one
- **5 Minutes**: That's all it takes for your first pattern!

## 🎨 Pattern Creation Tips

### **🌟 Best Practices**

- **Use Clean Years**: Choose years with minimal existing contributions for clearest results
- **Mix Intensity Levels**: Use levels 0-4 for better contrast and visibility
- **Test Small First**: Start with simple patterns to understand how it works
- **Public Repositories**: Make sure your repo is public for contributions to show

### **💡 Understanding GitHub's Display**

GitHub automatically scales your contribution intensity based on your yearly activity:

- GitHub finds your highest and lowest contribution days
- Divides this range into 4 visual intensity levels
- **Tip**: Mix different levels (0-4) in your design for best visual contrast

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **You Design**: Create patterns using our visual editor
2. **We Generate**: Get a custom shell script with precise commit dates
3. **You Execute**: Run the script in your repository
4. **GitHub Displays**: Your art appears on your contribution graph!

The script creates the exact number of commits needed for each day to achieve your desired pattern intensity.
