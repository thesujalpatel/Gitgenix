## üé® Design Questions

### What makes a good pattern?

- **High contrast** ‚Üí Use intensity levels 0 and 4 for clear visibility
- **Simple shapes** ‚Üí Bold, recognizable designs work best
- **Consider timing** ‚Üí Plan when you want your art to appear
- **Test first** ‚Üí Preview patterns before committing

### Can I edit existing patterns?

Yes! Use the JSON export/import feature to save your work and make modifications later.

### How do I share patterns?

Click the share button in the pattern editor to get a shareable link, or export as JSON to share with others.

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Setup

### How do I create a new repository?

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name it something like `github-art` or `contribution-art`
3. Make it public so your art shows on your profile
4. Initialize with a README
5. Clone it locally where you'll run the script

### Should I use an existing repository?

For best results, use a dedicated repository for your art. This keeps your main projects clean and makes it easy to manage your designs.

### Can I delete the commits later?

Yes, but this will remove your art from the contribution graph. The commits are real Git history, so standard Git operations apply.

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

### The script isn't working

**Most common solutions:**

- Ensure you're in the correct repository directory
- Check that Git is properly configured with your email/name
- Verify the repository exists and you have write access
- On Windows, try running in Git Bash instead of PowerShell

### My art isn't showing up

**Check these items:**

- Repository must be public for art to appear on your profile
- Commits must be authored with your GitHub email address
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub to update the contribution graph
- Ensure the dates in your pattern align with your intended display year

### Pattern looks different than expected

- Verify the year settings match your intended display period
- Check that intensity levels are set correctly (0-4)
- Consider that GitHub's contribution graph starts on Sunday

_Need immediate help? Check our [Quick Start Guide](./QUICK_START.md) for a 5-minute setup walkthrough!_

- **High Contrast**: Use intensity levels 0 and 4 for clear visibility
- **Clean Years**: Target years with minimal existing contributions
- **Simple Designs**: Complex patterns may not display well at GitHub's small scale
- **Test First**: Start with simple patterns to understand the process

### How many commits does each intensity level create?

- **Level 0**: 0 commits (no activity)
- **Level 1**: 10 commits (light activity)
- **Level 2**: 20 commits (moderate activity)
- **Level 3**: 30 commits (high activity)
- **Level 4**: 40 commits (maximum activity)

### Can I create patterns spanning multiple years?

Yes! Gitgenix supports multi-year patterns. Select multiple years in the year selector and design across year boundaries.

### Will this affect my existing commits?

No, Gitgenix creates new commits with specific dates. Your existing commits remain unchanged. However, we recommend using a dedicated repository for contribution art.

### Why isn't my pattern showing on GitHub?

Common reasons:

- **Wait Time**: GitHub can take up to 24 hours to update contribution graphs
- **Repository Visibility**: Ensure your repository is public for contributions to appear
- **Contrast**: Use higher contrast intensity levels (0 and 4)
- **Date Range**: Verify commits are within GitHub's display range

### Can I edit a pattern after generating the script?

Yes! You can:

- Modify the pattern and generate a new script
- Import previously exported patterns
- Share patterns and re-import them for editing

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't load or is very slow

**Solutions**:

- **Clear Browser Cache**: Force refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **Try Different Browser**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure stable internet for initial load
- **Disable Extensions**: Some browser extensions may interfere
- **Enable JavaScript**: Gitgenix requires JavaScript to function

### Repository validation keeps failing

**Common Issues**:

- **Typos**: Double-check username and repository spelling
- **Repository Access**: Ensure repository exists and is accessible
- **Private Repositories**: Public repositories work best for contribution display
- **Case Sensitivity**: GitHub usernames and repositories are case-sensitive

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Verify repository exists
https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY

# Check if you have access
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
```

### Script won't run or produces errors

**Windows (PowerShell)**:

```powershell
# Enable script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Run the script
.\gitgenix.ps1
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash)**:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x gitgenix.sh

# Run the script
./gitgenix.sh
```

**Common Script Issues**:

- **Wrong Directory**: Run script inside your Git repository
- **Git Not Configured**: Set up Git username and email
- **Permission Issues**: Check file permissions and execution policy

### Pattern sharing isn't working

**Possible Causes**:

- **Firebase Connection**: Check browser console for Firebase errors
- **Network Issues**: Ensure stable internet connection
- **Browser Blocking**: Some browsers block third-party connections

**Solutions**:

- **Try Again**: Network issues are often temporary
- **Different Browser**: Test in an incognito/private window
- **Export Instead**: Use JSON export as an alternative

### Animations are laggy or not working

**Solutions**:
